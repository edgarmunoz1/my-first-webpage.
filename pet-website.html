<h1>"Scooby doo where are you.io"</h1>
<p>When I was a little kid I had a puppy named "Scooby" unfurtunately one day he went outside and we never saw him again, I still think about him every once in a while and I wish we would've had some of those amazing apps back then like the ones
we have now, all you need is a smart phone and you can see where your pet is at all times,
isin't that amazing, I think so... Technology inovation is not only making humans life a lot better and easier but is also helping with the care of our little hairy friends, that's one of the many reasons I love thecnology so much and I feel so bless that I will get the chance
to work doing just that fixing technology problems and why not, inovate whatever thecnology that I'll be working on
to make my world a little better, our world....   </p>
<h2>Here is a list of some of the pets i have had:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Scooby</li>
  <li>Tamalito</li>
  <li>Cocusa</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see I've only only had
three dogs I don't remember playing with them
a lot to be honest, but I do remember giving them
alot of love that they so much needed.</p>
